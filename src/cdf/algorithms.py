"""
Geometry basics -- reusable Rhino.Geometry functions for Grasshopper.

Adding a new function with Copilot
-----------------------------------
1. Open this file and select this chat model, then ask Copilot something like:
   "Add a function here, all in Rhino geometry, that builds a <your shape/idea>.
   Follow the same style as create_cone / create_fractal_tree (defaults for
   optional inputs, a docstring listing params, return a Rhino.Geometry object)."
2. Once the function is added, ask Copilot:
   "Give me the Python code to use this function in a Grasshopper GHPython 3
   component, importing it from computational_design_and_fabrication."
3. Copy the snippet Copilot gives you into a GHPython component, wire up the
   inputs as sliders/panels, and set the output variable (e.g. `a`).

    """Build a crocheted hyperbolic form ("pseudosphere") as a mesh.

    The function follows the crochet pattern step by step:
      1. a small ring made of chain stitches,
      2. a first round of double crochets into the ring,
      3. more rounds, where every stitch gets `increase` new stitches.

    Each stitch is one mesh vertex. After every new round the stitches are
    relaxed like small springs: a stitch wants to keep its width and its
    height, and two stitches cannot be in the same place. Each round has more
    stitches than a flat circle has room for, so the surface has to ruffle.

    Params:
        rounds (int): Number of rounds worked into the ring. Default 4.
            Stitch count is multiplied by `increase` every round, so keep
            this low (5 rounds with increase 3 is already 972 stitches).
        first_round (int): Stitches in the first round. Default 12.
        increase (int): New stitches worked into each stitch. Default 3.
            1 gives a tube, 2 gives soft ruffles, 3 gives dense ruffles.
        base_chain (int): Chain stitches in the starting ring. Default 4.
            Only sets the size of the hole in the middle.
        stitch_width (float): Width of one stitch. Default 1.0.
        stitch_height (float): Height of one round. Default 2.0
            (a double crochet is about twice as tall as it is wide).
        iterations (int): Relaxation steps after each round. Default 150.
            More steps give a smoother result but take longer.
        seed (int): Seed for the small random offsets that let the surface
            ruffle. Same seed gives the same shape. Default 1.
        max_stitches (int): Safety limit on stitches in a single round.
            Rounds that would exceed it are skipped, so the form stops
            growing instead of freezing Rhino. Default 1500.

    Returns:
        Rhino.Geometry.Mesh: The crocheted surface. Each vertex is the top
        of one stitch, each ring of vertices is one round.
