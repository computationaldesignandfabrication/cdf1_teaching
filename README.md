## Requirements

* Windows 10 Professional
* Rhino 8 / Grasshopper
* [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/?gclid=CjwKCAjwo9rtBRAdEiwA_WXcFoyH8v3m-gVC55J6YzR0HpgB8R-PwM-FClIIR1bIPYZXsBtbPRfJ8xoC6HsQAvD_BwE)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

## Dependencies

## Getting Started

### Cloning the CDF Repository

* Firstly, create a **workspace** directory in your File Explorer:

    C:\Users\your_username\workspace

* Secondly, open Github Desktop and clone the [CDF repository](https://github.com/computationaldesignandfabrication/cdf1_teaching) into your **workspace** folder.

**Done! Now you can go to VS Code, Rhino, or Grasshopper to run the example files of CDF.**

First time using VS Code and on Windows? Make sure select the correct terminal profile: Ctrl+Shift+P, Terminal: Select Default Profile and select Command Prompt.
